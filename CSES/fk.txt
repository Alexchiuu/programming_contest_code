    As technology advances, messaging with text have become a more common way of
communication among people. One of the differences between speaking in person and 
chatting by text is that using only text often lack facial expression that can be important 
in communication. This is where those emojies come in handy. By using emojies, people can 
express their emotion using those cute little illustrations beside the words, creating 
an more vigorous atmosphere in the chat group. For instance, the first emoji in the form
is a face smiling with joy. This emoji can be useful when we want to show that we are
happy or agree with somthing. Sending this emoji rather that saying that "I am happy" is
more friendly and briefly. Other emojies can be used in their specific situation, not only
saving our time but also making the conversation readily interpretable.
    For me, I've always been using emojies in my daily messaging. It usually does great
work and helps a lot during conversation. But there is one time that it messed up.
That is when I was apologizing for my late of the band rehearsal. When apologizing with
text message, using emojies might let others think that I didn't view my mistake seriously
and still want to save time instead of sincerely apologizing. Avoid using emojies and 
carefully choose the words when apologize can deal with such conditions. All in all,
emojies is a great tool that comes in handy in text messeging while we should be careful
not to use it often in some formal messages.
